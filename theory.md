- the brother or sister of JS, with some discipline
- built on top of JS
- more robust and maintanable: 
    - static typing (JS with type checking)
    - code completion
    - refactoring
    - new features (over time these are added to JS) (these features will be used in the future JS)


- what I notice:
    - when I run some JS code, the system will generate a .js file, as I am not using any TS code
    - handy errors when it comes to type checking
